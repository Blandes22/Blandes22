- I’m @Blandes22
- As of now I am still very much so learning how to code. The end game will be learning about software engineering, machine learning, and game development.
- My strongest language is c++ however, I am also working on learning Python, JavaScript, SQL, CSS, and HTML.
- I am currently working on some projects based loosely off of freecodecamp(dot)org. They will be posted as they are finished.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help me further my knowledge or help others furhter their knowledge.
